## My process

Essentially, my goal with this project was to strip out as much of the "cool" tools that I'm using to using and get down to the core basics of building an application. For development, I did use vitejs as a dev server and build tool and I did leverage a couple of Postcss plugins, but in terms of the actual html and css, I tried to keep things as vanilla as possible... though I did do some code splitting and importing to make my lift a bit easier!

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vite
- PostCss

### Continued development

I'd love to tackle the animation concept that is included in the challenge. It would be cool to animate the phone illustration in as simulate the conversation happening in real time on page load
